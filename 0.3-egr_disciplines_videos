Yes, there are several popular methods and YouTube videos that can help students identify suitable engineering disciplines for undergraduate studies:

1. YouTube videos:
   - "Choose the Right Engineering Major!" provides an overview of various engineering majors and the high school subjects needed for each discipline[2].
   - "How to Choose Your Engineering Major" offers insights into different engineering disciplines and factors to consider when making a choice[5].
   - "Engineering Disciplines Explained!" is a playlist breaking down various types of engineering to help students figure out their preferred discipline[6].
   - "The BEST Engineering Major If You Can't Decide" discusses the best engineering major to study if you're undecided and want to keep your options open[8].
   - "ALL Engineering Majors & Careers Explained | 22 Types of Engineers" covers 22 different engineering majors and disciplines to help students understand the differences and similarities between them[10].

2. Methods for choosing an engineering discipline:
   - Consider the breadth of the discipline, ranging from broad (e.g., Mechanical and Industrial Engineering) to narrow (e.g., Acoustics or Biomedical Engineering)[5].
   - Evaluate the difficulty of the major by examining the required math courses on university websites[5].
   - Align your interests with the discipline, as this can significantly impact your perception of difficulty and tedium in your studies[5].
   - Explore the "Big Six" engineering disciplines (Mechanical, Chemical, Civil, Electrical, Software, and Industrial) to understand the foundation of most engineering fields[10].

These resources can help students gain a comprehensive understanding of various engineering disciplines and make informed decisions about their undergraduate studies.
